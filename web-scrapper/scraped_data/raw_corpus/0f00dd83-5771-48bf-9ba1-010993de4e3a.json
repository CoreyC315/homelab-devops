An important update for readers in the United States . Please don't skip this 1-minute read. This fundraiser will soon be over, but we haven't yet hit our goal. If you're like us, you've used Wikipedia countless times. To settle an argument with a friend. To satisfy a curiosity. Whether it's 3 in the morning or afternoon, Wikipedia is useful in your life. Please give $2.75 . After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised\u2014created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a nonprofit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire. Just 2% of our readers donate, so if you have given in the past and Wikipedia still provides you with $2.75 worth of knowledge, donate today. If you are undecided, remember any contribution helps. Please select an amount ( $ ) . The average donation in the United States is around $13 . Many first-time donors give $2.75 . All that matters is that you're choosing to stand up for free, open information; and for that, you have our gratitude. $2.75 $ 5 $ 10 $ 20 $ 30 $ 50 $ 100 Other How often would you like to donate?
