A Proxmox cluster allows you to manage multiple nodes from a single interface, making administration more efficient and improving operational control. While this article won\u2019t cover Ceph storage or high availability setup, we\u2019ll focus on creating, managing, and troubleshooting a Proxmox cluster to help you streamline workloads and enhance centralized management. Why Deploy a Proxmox Cluster? A Proxmox cluster is a group of interconnected Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) nodes that allows for seamless management, scaling, and security. Clustering is beneficial because: Provides a centralized GUI (Graphical User Interface) to manage multiple servers. Enables resource balancing across nodes for better performance. Supports business continuity by reducing downtime. Enhances security and compliance by simplifying infrastructure oversight. As organizations shift toward private cloud environments for better control, compliance, and security, understanding how to deploy a Proxmox cluster effectively is essential. Prerequisites for Deployment Before you begin, make sure that: You have at least two or more Proxmox nodes. All nodes are updated to the latest version of Proxmox . Each node has a unique hostname and static IP address. VMs are backed up before clustering to prevent data loss. Nodes are connected to the same network. Your cluster architecture aligns with scalability and compliance requirements. Step 1: Prepare Your Proxmox Nodes 1.1 Update Proxmox For stability and security, update the package database on each node: Step 2: Create a Proxmox Cluster 2.1 Create a Cluster on the First Node Navigate to Data Center > Cluster. Click Create Cluster. Enter a Cluster Name. Set the Cluster Network (IP address of the primary node). Click Create. Once the cluster is created, Proxmox will generate a Join Information Token, which will be used to add additional nodes. Step 3: Add Nodes to the Cluster 3.1 Join Additional Nodes Copy the Join Information Token from the primary node. Log into the second node and navigate to Data Center > Cluster. Click Join Cluster. Paste the Join Information Token. Enter the peer\u2019s root password of the primary node. Set the IP for the node you want to join. Click Join and wait for the process to complete. If the process fails, double check that: There are no running VMs on the node. The node does not have conflicting VM IDs. Repeat the process for additional nodes. Pro tip : This is where Proxmox Backup Server comes in handy . If the process fails, you have your VMs ready for easy restoration. Step 4: Verify Cluster Status Run the following command to check the cluster: pvecm status This will list all nodes, their IDs, and quorum status, ensuring operational stability and performance consistency. How Do I Remove Nodes From the Cluster? 5.1 Shut Down the Node Power off the node to remove: shutdown -h now 5.2 Delete the Node From an active node: pvecm delnode <nodename> For a two-node cluster losing quorum: pvecm expected 1 # On the remaining node to restore functionality Pro tip: If you only have two nodes, you may need a fresh reinstall to remove a node due to quorum limitations. Reinstallation is an option if the cluster database is corrupted, but not required. Troubleshooting Common Issues 1. Node Fails to Join the Cluster Ensure VMs are stopped or removed before joining. Verify all nodes are on the same Proxmox version. Restart cluster services if necessary: systemctl restart pve-cluster 2. Cluster Join Hangs or Errors Out Refresh the Proxmox GUI . Manually restart Proxmox services: systemctl restart corosync Looking to migrate without overlap costs? Migration shouldn\u2019t drain your budget. With HorizonIQ\u2019s 2 Months Free, you can move workloads, skip the overlap bills, and gain extra time to switch providers without double paying. Get 2 Months Free Ready to Deploy Your Proxmox Cluster? Deploying a Proxmox cluster is a cost-effective, scalable, and secure way to manage virtualization environments efficiently.
